# De fyra linguisterna
A chat for learning a new language together with other people.

## Background
There are several existing chat bots for learning new languages.
However, we believe that you learn better when talking to another human.
This web-app allows people to chat with each other with and get some hints from a bot when needed.
In this way, you can learn the new language fast and maybe even find new friends while doing so.
